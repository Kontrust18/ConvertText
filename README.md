# ConvertText

The result of the first test task from "Fntastic" for the position of "Unreal Engine Developer".


Task:
The goal is to convert the original string, to a new string, where each character is replaced by a character
“ ( ” if the character occurs only once, or to “ ) “ if the character occurs more than once.
When solving, the program should ignore capital letters when detecting duplicates (i.e. "A" and "a" are the same character).
The code should work with Cyrillic and Latin.
Example input and output data:
"din" => "((("
"recede" => "()()()"
"Success" => ")())())"
"(( @" => "))(("
